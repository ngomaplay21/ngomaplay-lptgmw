The music player can handle basic playback functionality, and the interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing.\n\nThe logo's aesthetic (white \"N\" on black background with \"NgomaPlay\" text) is reflected throughout the app's design with the black background, white text, and green accent colors that create a premium music streaming experience."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-21T13:29:14Z"}]
